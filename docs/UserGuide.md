### 3.2 Application homepage explanation

Here is how our application's homepage works

![UiExplanation](images/UiExplanation.png)

#### 3.2.1 Help Buttons (pink)
* Buttons have been placed at the top of our application to help you to exit the application and access the help function using your mouse.

#### 3.2.2 Command Box (yellow)
* Location for you to key in your inputs.

#### 3.2.3 Output Display (orange)
* Here is where our application will echo out your inputs entered.
* Results will also be displayed in this section when the appropriate commands have been added.

#### 3.2.4 Module List (purple)
* Here are the modules stored in our module tracker database.
* Do note that we have included some modules for you to test out our [features](#4-features).

#### 3.2.5 MC goal Progress (green)

Tracks and displays the number of Mcs completed in total, and for each course requirement. <br>

![Mcs Display](images/mcsDisplay.png)

The user's progress is displayed in the form of:
* The number of Mcs completed for that category, over the number of required Mcs.
* A progress bar filled according to the level of completion.

**Total Mcs completed display:**

![total Mcs Display](images/totalMcsCompletedDisplay.png)
* Shows the total number of Mcs taken, over the user's set Mc goal.
* The total number of Mcs taken is calculated from all modules taken before the current semester.
    * For example: If the current semester is year 1 semester 2, the total number of Mcs will be calculated
      from all modules taken in year 1 semester 1 only.

**Course requirements display:**

![requirements Mcs Display](images/courseRequirementsDisplay.png)
* Shows the total number of Mcs taken for that requirement, over the number of Mcs needed to satisfy the requirement.
* The total number of Mcs taken is calculated from modules taken before the current semester, which have been tagged with the specific tags.
    * For example: Mcs for modules taken which are tagged with "ge" (`tag/ge`) will be counted into the total number of MCs taken for the GE requirement.
* Modules with the following tags will be used in calculating the Mcs completed for the corresponding requirement:

Requirement | Tag (not case sensitive)
------------|-----------
GE | "ge"
UE | "ue"
Foundation | "foundation"
Breadth and Depth | "breadth and depth"
IT Professionalism | "it professionalism"
Math and Science | "math and science"

Notes:
* If the Mc requirement has been satisfied, the completed Mcs and progress bar will be coloured light blue.
* If the Mc requirement is not satisfied, the completed Mcs and progress bar will be coloured pink.

#### 3.2.6 Current Semester (dark blue)
* Displays the current year and semester that the application is in.

#### 3.2.7 Current MC goal (light blue)
* Displays your current mc goal.

### 3.3 Command format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs to be entered by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add m/MODULE`, `MODULE` is a parameter which is entered by the user(such as `add m/GEQ1000` or `add m/CS2030S`).

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `c/CODE [tag/TAG]` can be used as `c/CS2103T tag/core` or as `c/CS2103T`.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `m/GEQ1000 m/GEQ1000`, only `m/GEQ1000` will be taken.

* Inputs for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### 3.4 Command terminology

## 4. Features

This section gives you a detailed explanation on how each of our features work.

For an easy reference, we have decided to split our features into 3 different sub-categories:
* Module features
* Academic Calendar features
* Miscellaneous features

The following sub-categories will explain the intended purpose for the set of features.

### 4.1 Module

Module features consist of features that allows you to be able to add and remove modules from our database.
Do note that these features do not directly affect the modules that are currently stored in your academic plan.
(we will explain how such features can **indirectly** affect the modules that are currently stored in your academic plan  in the [FAQ](#5-faq) section) <br>

Such features include adding a new module into the database, removing a module from the database, as well as finding, editing, and listing modules that are in the database.

#### 4.1.1 Adding a module: `add`

Adds a module to the module tracker database.

Format: `FORMAT: add c/CODE t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION m/MC [tag/TAG]`
* `MC` must be a **positive integer** (1,2,3...).
* `CODE` must follow the NUSMods module code format.

Examples:
* `add c/CS2103T t/Software Engineering d/Covers the main areas of software development m/4 tag/core`
is equivalent to adding a Module with a code of `CS2103T`, a title called `Software Engineering`, a description `Covers the main areas of software development`, consists of `4` MCs and a `core` tag to the database.

#### 4.1.2 Deleting a module : `delete`

Deletes a module from the module tracker database.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes a module at the specified `INDEX`.
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed module list.
* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** (1, 2, 3 ...).

Example:
* `delete 2` is equivalent to deleting the 2nd module in the module tracker database.

#### 4.1.3 Listing current modules: `list`

Shows a list of all modules that are in the module tracker database.

Format: `list`

#### 4.1.4 Finding a module: `find`

Shows a list of all the modules in the module tracker database that contains the given keyword(s).

Format: `FORMAT: find [c/] [t/] [d/] [m/] [tag/] [y/] [s/] KEYWORDS`
* `KEYWORDS` refers to the words that the application will search the modules by.
* If no optional parameters are entered, the application will search within all the modules'
  components for matching `KEYWORDS`
* If optional parameters are entered, the application will search within the modules'
  specified components for matching `KEYWORDS`

Examples:
* `find CS`is equivalent to displaying any modules that contain the word "CS" in the code, title, description, mc or tag.
* `find c/ t/ CS GE` is equivalent to displaying any modules that contain the words "CS" or "GE" in the code or title.
* `find c/ CS2040S` is equivalent to displaying any modules that contain the word "CS2040S" in the code.
* `find tag/ UE` is equivalent to displaying any modules that contain the word "UE" in the tag.


#### 4.1.5 Editing a module : `edit`

Edits an existing module in the module tracker's database.

Format: `edit INDEX [c/CODE] [t/TITLE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [m/MC] [tag/TAG]`

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* The given value for the field(s) must be **different** from value that it is replacing.
* For values supplied to the `CODE` field, the value must **NOT** be identical with any other module's `CODE` field in the module tracker database .
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed module list.
* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** (1, 2, 3 ...).

Examples:
* `edit 1 c/CS2103T t/Software Engineering` is equivalent to
  editing the code of the 1st module in the database to be CS2103T,
  as well as editing the title of the 1st module in the database to be Software Engineering respectively.
